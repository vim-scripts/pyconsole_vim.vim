This plugin allows for the execution of windows based command line commands such as "dir", "findstr" or "ping" directly within a vim buffer.

Start up an embedded console from within vim by:
        :call PyConsole()
    or the windows command line by:
        gvim "+call PyConsole()"

See http://pyconsole.googlecode.com/ for a flash demo.

Requirements:
- Vim 7.0 or above: http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc
- Python 2.4 or above: http://www.python.org/download/windows/
- Python for Windows extensions: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
- Python ctypes module (not necessary for Python 2.5 and above): http://sourceforge.net/projects/ctypes/

Based on the Python PyConsole project.
